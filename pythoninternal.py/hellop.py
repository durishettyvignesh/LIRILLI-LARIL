r = "Describe the process of photosynthesis in plants."

response = """Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. The process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain the pigment chlorophyll that captures light energy.
The overall equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as follows:

6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2 

The interface in object-oriented languages like Python is a set of method signatures that a class must implement without providing the actual implementing code. It defines a contract that any class implementing the interface must follow.
In Python, an interface is defined using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the abc module. An interface can include abstract methods that must be overridden in any subclass.

here's an example of how to define and use an interface in python:

use framer website to create a web page
then host it on vercel 
buy a free domain from freenom and link it to vercel hosting

\a is often used to escape dwajij
